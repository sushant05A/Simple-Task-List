# Simple-Task-List
 Task Management App This is a simple task management application built using Python and Tkinter GUI library. The application allows users to add, remove, list, and recommend tasks based on their priorities.  Features: Add Task: Users can add tasks with descriptions and priorities (Low, Medium, High). Remove Task: Tasks can be removed by providing their descriptions. List Tasks: Displays a list of all tasks in a separate window. Recommend Task: Recommends a high-priority task based on machine learning predictions. Machine Learning Integration: Utilizes CountVectorizer and MultinomialNB from scikit-learn to predict task priorities. Trains a Naive Bayes classifier using existing task descriptions and priorities. Recommends tasks based on the predicted highest priority. Usage: Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git Run the application: python task_manager.py Requirements: Python 3.x Tkinter (usually comes with Python installation) scikit-learn Note: Task data is stored in a CSV file (tasks.csv) in the same directory. Make sure to have Python and required dependencies installed to run the app
